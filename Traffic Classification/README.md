#PHASE2: 

In this phase of the project we will implement a supervised classification algorithm for the purpose of seperating the trafffic vehicles. We will use the SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) for the classificication of the traffic vehicles image. We would also use the Histogram of augmented gradient(HOG) for feature extarcting from data.

After importing all the libreries we will visualize the vehicle and non vehicle images by the following code.
