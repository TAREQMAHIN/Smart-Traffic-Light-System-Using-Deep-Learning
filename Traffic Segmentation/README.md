###In the 1st phase we have to devide traffic juction into three different phases:
> High traffic zone

> Medium traffic zone

> Low traffic zone 

We will also conqure the traffic vehicles into different segments like heavy vehicles,medium heavy vehicles and small vehicles. 

We will use Semantic segmentation, Histrogram of oriented gradient , thresh holding and egde detection for the segmentation of the traffic vehicles into different zones. 

>Sementic Segmentation: Semantic segmentation refers to the process of linking each pixel in an image to a class label. These labels could include a person, car, flower, piece of furniture, etc.  of a Deep Convolutional Network for Semantic Image Segmentation.It classify all the images into different pixel and classes. 

> Histogram of oriented gradient(HOG): It uses histogram of group of pixels based on "Gray Level". 

> Thresh Holding: Threshholding means devide an image into foreground and background. 

> Edge Detection: Identify Sharp changes and discontinueties in brightness.
