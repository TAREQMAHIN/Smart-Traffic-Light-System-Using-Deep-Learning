# Smart-Traffic-Light-System-Using-Deep-Learning

**Integration of a vehicle detection system in a traffic light camera, that could easily track the number of useful things simultaneously.**

● How many vehicles are present at the traffic junction during the day? 

● What time does the traffic build-up? 

● What kind of vehicles are traversing the junction (heavy vehicles, cars, etc.)?

● Is there a way to optimize the traffic and distribute it through a different street?
